- Title:- **E-commerce Analysis**
- Created by:- Mitali Bag
- Date:- 12-09-2024
- Tool used:- MS SQL Server

# Introduction :-
- This project involves the analysis of an e-commerce dataset to extract meaningful insights and trends related to customer purchases, product performance, and sales targets.
- I will be using SQL to analyse the data.

# Data :-
- This dataset was found on Kaggle. It includes information on an Indian e-commerce sales dataset that is divided into three CSV files: Sales target, Order details, and List of Orders.
- List of Orders- This dataset contains purchase information. The information includes ID, Date of Purchase and customer details.
- Order Details- This dataset contains order ID, with the order price, quantity, profit, category and subcategory of the product.
- Sales target- This dataset contains the sales target amount and date for each product category.

# Approach :-
- Acquired the e-commerce data from a publicly available source and imported it into a SQL database.
- Use SQL to extract relevant information from the data, such as the number of orders, total revenue, and profit for each category and sub-category to identify top-performing and underperforming products.
- Grouped orders by profitability (profitable, loss-making, or neutral) to assess overall business health and trends in order performance.
- Evaluated whether categories met their sales targets by comparing actual revenue to set targets, and identifying areas where performance exceeded or fell short of expectations.
- Assessed monthly profitability to uncover seasonal trends and determine which months contributed the most to overall profit.
- Analyzed state-wise profitability to understand geographic patterns and identify high-performing regions for potential strategic focus.
